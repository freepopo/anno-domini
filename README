Welcome to Anno Domini 2.1!

I'm excited to release this improved calendar program. Here are some improvements in this version:

	1. Compatible with CakePHP 1.2 RC3
	2. Improved back-end layout and design
	3. TONS of code trimmed for faster queries and page rendering
	4. Location field added
	5. Untimed events added
	6. Menu system built on CSS, not on Javascript
	7. Improved User management for adding, editing, and deleting multiple admin users
	8. Improved URL handling and better URL routes
	9. Improved front-end design, but still minimalist to make editing the design easy
	10. User login/logout handled with Auth component, improved security of hashed passwords

------INSTALLATION NOTES------

1. Set up the MySQL database
	
	-	To do this, just open the anno-domini > config > sql > annodomini_mysql_setup.sql file using PHPMyAdmin or any other MySQL database application. It will automatically create the tables for Anno Domini to work immediately.
	
	-	Edit the annodomini > app > config > database.php file to reflect your MySQL connection settings.
	
2. Install the anno-domini folder on your server
	
	-	Just place the folder in the root folder on your server.
	
	-	Make sure Cake 1.2 RC3 or later is installed. Take note of the include path to the Cake libraries.
	
	-	Open anno-domini > webroot > index.php and change lines 44, 51, and 58 to reflect your server setup.
		*	ROOT should be set to the name of the folder holding the anno-domini directory.
		*	APP_DIR should be set to 'anno-domini' if you have renamed the install folder.
		*	CAKE_CORE_INCLUDE_PATH must be set to the server path of your Cake core libraries, but not including a trailing slash or the "cake" directory name
	
3. Launch the application!
	
	-	Pull up the anno-domini directory in your web browser (e.g., http://domain.com/anno-domini/)
	
	-	The calendar should be up and running. If you experience problems, check out www.cakephp.org for information on how to get Cake working correctly.
	
	-	Go to http://domain.com/anno-domini/admin to create events. The default username and password is "admin" and "admin". You can change these by going to the "Users" area of the administration panel.
	
------OPTIONAL SETTINGS------
	
	Anno Domini houses its global variables in the annodomini > app > config > core.php file. You will find these at the very bottom of the file under the comment:
	
	/**
	 * Anno Domini Calendar Settings
	 *
	 */
	 
	 -	Calendar.name is the global name of the calendar. This will be used in email submissions and the <title> tags in the layouts.
	 
	 -	Calendar.admin_email is the email address where you want calendar submissions to be sent.
	 
	 -	Calendar.max_items is the number of events you want displayed for a single day before a "more..." link appears. This helps keep your calendar from getting too crowded visually.
	 
------IMPORTANT URLS------
	
	Some areas of the program aren't accessible inside the application by clicking links, but they are accessible by entering direct URLs:
	
	- Event submissions: /anno-domini/submit
	- Administration panel: /anno-domini/admin
	
------COLLABORATION, HELPS------

	Please consider contributing to this project. Some enhancements that could improve the application include:
	
	-	Recurring events management
	-	ACL management of calendar administration
	-	UI improvements! (Always a concern/goal)
	-	jQuery instead of Prototype integration (especially in jQuery someday replaces Prototype in the Cake core!)
	-	Improved security of form submissions
	-	Improved email management to allow for user requests, etc.
	-	Exporting to iCal/Google Calendar/other calendar formats
	-	Mass events editing
	
	Official support is handled in two forums:
